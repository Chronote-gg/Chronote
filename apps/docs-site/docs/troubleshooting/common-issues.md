Use this checklist when something looks off.

## Chronote does not join or record

- Confirm bot permissions for voice channel connect and speak.
- Check whether auto-record is enabled for the current scope.
- Verify the channel still has active participants.

## Notes quality is lower than expected

- Add missing terms to `/dictionary`.
- Refresh stale project context in `/context`.
- Check for noisy input audio or low speaking volume.

## Billing or access surprises

- Confirm the active guild subscription status.
- Verify user permissions in Discord for the target channel.
- Re-check workspace and server selection in portal views.

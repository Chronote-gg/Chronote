Use this guide when writing or editing public docs.

## Writing standards

- Write for admins and end users, not internal implementation details.
- Lead with intent, then provide actionable steps.
- Keep headings short and scannable.
- Use examples only when they reduce ambiguity.

## Content standards

- Place user-facing docs in this docs app (`apps/docs-site`).
- Keep internal runbooks and engineering notes in repo-internal `docs/`.
- For user-facing product changes, include a docs delta in the same PR.
- Use `docs-exempt` only for purely technical changes with clear rationale.

## Whats New guidance

- Keep release notes curated and periodic.
- Bundle related changes into one concise update.
- Link to setup pages for any new feature rollout.

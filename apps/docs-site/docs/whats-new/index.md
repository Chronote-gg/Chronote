## 2026

### Public documentation launch

- Product documentation is now available at [docs.chronote.gg](https://docs.chronote.gg).
- Docs cover getting started, features, admin setup, and troubleshooting.
- Documentation updates ship alongside product changes.

### Meeting sharing

- Share meeting notes via a public link from the web portal or Discord.
- Recipients can view the meeting summary, notes, and transcript without joining your server.

### Notes correction flow

- Suggest corrections to meeting notes directly from Discord or the web portal.
- Corrections use the original transcript as ground truth, so the AI cannot add content that was not discussed.
- Versioned notes track every edit with author attribution.

### Text-to-speech

- Use `/tts enable` to have your chat messages spoken aloud in the meeting voice channel.
- Choose from multiple voice options with `/tts voice`.
- Use `/say` for one-off messages without enabling ongoing TTS.

### Ask past meetings

- Use `/ask` to query your meeting history with natural-language questions.
- Answers include citations linking to specific meetings.
- Filter by tags or scope to a single channel.

Chronote now stops recording join and leave timeline events once a meeting has moved into processing or finished state.

## What changed

- Join and leave events are captured only while a meeting is actively in progress.
- Once meeting end processing begins, late channel activity is no longer appended to the meeting timeline.
- Meeting timelines now stay aligned with the actual meeting window.

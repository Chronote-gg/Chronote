Chronote integrations extend meeting outputs into other systems.

## Planned integrations

- **Notion**: push meeting notes to a Notion database (one row per meeting).
- **Remote MCP**: read-only meeting access through a remote MCP server.

Both integrations will include dedicated setup and operations docs when released.

## Integration principles

- Keep source-of-truth meeting data in Chronote.
- Start with minimal safe scopes in v1.
- Reuse existing Chronote auth and permission checks.
